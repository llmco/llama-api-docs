Plug and Plai is an open source library aiming to simplify the integration of AI plugins into open-source language models (LLMs).

It provides utility functions to get a list of active plugins from [plugnplai](plugnplai.com) directory, get plugin manifests, and extract OpenAPI specifications and load plugins.

<Tip>
  Visit the [plugnplai](plugnplai.com) website or the
  [repository](https://github.com/edreisMD/plugnplai) for more information on
  using the library.
</Tip>

## Integration with llm

You can install Plug and Plai using pip:

```bash
pip install plugnplai
```

In the example, we will search for a weather plugin.

1. Use plugnplai library to load plugins from the database: https://plugnplai.com
2. Let's choose weather plugin
3. Install the plugin using Plugins.install_and_activate
4. Get an array of the functions schemas using the built in function plugins.functions

```python plugnplai
import plugnplai as pl

allurls = pl.get_plugins()

urls = [url for url in allurls if ("weather" in url)]
print("URLs: ",urls)

plugins = pl.Plugins.install_and_activate(urls[3])
print("Function: ",plugins.functions)
```

```json Response
URLs:  ["https://weather--vicentescode.repl.co", "https://openai-plugin.xweather.com", "https://weather.mixerbox.com", "https://weathergpt-bay-six.vercel.app"]
Function:  [{"name": "WeatherWizard_checkWeatherUsingGET", "description": "Use the WeatherWizard plugin to automatically fetch current weather information for a specific location when it"s being generated. The plugin will return weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and other relevant information, as well as a link to a page that has all the information. Links will always be returned and should be shown to the user. The weather data can be used to provide users with up-to-date and accurate weather information for their desired location.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "Location for which to retrieve weather information."}}, "required": ["location"]}}]
```

Now let's run llm with the new functions

```python Llama API
import json
from llamaapi import LlamaAPI

llama = LlamaAPI("<your_api_token>")

api_request_json = {
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "How is the weather in New York?"},
  ],
  "functions": plugins.functions,
  "stream": False,
  "function_call": "force",
  "max_tokens": 800
}

# Make your request and handle the response
response = llama.run(api_request_json)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

```json Response
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": null,
        "function_call": {
          "name": "WeatherWizard_checkWeatherUsingGET",
          "arguments": {
            "location": "New York"
          }
        }
      },
      "finish_reason": "function_call"
    }
  ]
}
```
